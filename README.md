Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.
I was a little tired of having long alias files and everything strewn about(which is extremely common on other dotfiles projects, too).
That led to this project being much more topic-centric. I realized I could split a lot of things up into the main areas I used, so I structured the project accordingly.

## Installation

**Warning: If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository,
review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails.**

**Use at your own risk!**

There are various ways you can install the dotfiles either fork or clone or download repo.

* Option #1

```shell
wget https://github.com/mmphego/dot-files/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
rsync -uar --delete-after dot-files-master/{.,}* $HOME
cd $HOME
bash .dotfiles/.dotfiles_setup.sh install
```

* Option #2

```shell
cd $HOME
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/mmphego/dot-files
rsync -uar --delete-after dot-files/{.,}* $HOME
bash .dotfiles/.dotfiles_setup.sh install
```

The command (`bash .dotfiles/.dotfiles_setup.sh install`) will create symlinks for config files in your home directory.

After installation is complete, test if everything was installed successfully.

```shell
bash .dotfiles/.dotfiles_setup.sh test
```

To uninstall run;

```shell
bash .dotfiles/.dotfiles_setup.sh uninstall
```
